# MCT-Project-Disc
Role Automation bot for MCT discord  
Currently only written in Python, but it would be a great example and exersise to write this bot in every language tought at MCT to show what we're capable of.  
If you want to help us in this endeavour do not hesitate to contact me or any of the contributors of this project.

Planned languages:
* Python
* JavaScript
* C#
* Go
* Rust
* Java
* Ruby

## Dependencies
Windows:        `py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py`  
Linux:          `python3 -m pip install -U discord.py`  

## Planned Functionalities
### Predictive role assessment
In september we would like to reset all roles of the users so they can select the courses of the next year. If we could get advanced enough we can offer them a predicted course so they wouldn't have to go through the setup process again.  
For example:  
The end of the year is here, your modules have expired.  
Would you like to sign up for the following predicted modules?  
3 Web & App  
Yes -- No  

### Automatic role reset
Every year in september we should run a reset so everybody can select their modules and be in the correct channels, if we could automate this by date, that would be great.  
Perhaps even add an extra question in january for the second year students  

## Roles
For every Module in MCT  
For every year  
For every Course  

We have this many Roles zo we can give everybody a nice custom view for all their courses, even if they're taking some couses along for the next year
